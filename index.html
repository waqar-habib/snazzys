      <h1>Project Brief: Snazzy's Food Truck</h1>
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Snazzy’s Food Truck is a Contemporary Desi Street Eatery - an
          up-and-coming place to dine out in a casual setting with friends and
          family. Snazzy’s will offer a variety of items from the South Asian
          culture – featuring Indian/Pakistani foods fused with North American
          dishes to create a modern spin on delicious South Asian dishes.
          Whether its butter chicken pizza or Foodles, a spin off Lo Mein,
          Snazzy’s got it all. Not to mention, Chai – black tea leaves brewed
          with milk and sugar, will definitely put a smile on your face.
        </p>

        <h2>Business Needs</h2>
        <p>
          Being in the United States for about 15 years, I noticed that there
          were a lot of homeless people on the streets, no matter what city I
          visited. A lot of people would usually shrug and say, “oh they are
          just drug addicts! We don’t want to give our money to them, only so
          they can buy more drugs!” However, one does not realize that even they
          are human beings and aside from procuring drugs, they still need to
          eat throughout the day. Now I’m not saying that they are doing good to
          humanity by being drug addicts, but we still cannot eliminate them
          from society completely. This is the reason why I decided to open
          Snazzy’s so that the poor and the homeless don’t have to line up in
          soup kitchens to get their bland meals of the day – instead they could
          make their way to our food truck and get real, hot meals whenever they
          get hungry. Maybe some of those who turn up at our kitchen can be
          ambitious and we could onboard them as cooks to change their
          lives…this just maybe possible as well.
        </p>

        <h3>
          If Snazzy’s is successful, what will be the impact on the business?
        </h3>
        <p>
          If the business model behind Snazzy’s is a success, Snazzy’s might be
          able to upgrade to a full-size brick and mortar store all the while
          helping out the needy, one meal at a time.
        </p>
        <h3>Revenue Model</h3>
        <p>
          The revenue model behind Snazzy’s is simple - whenever any one of us
          stops by and buys a meal for themselves, they can opt to buy one extra
          meal for the needy. Additionally, the Snazzy’s team is willing to
          contribute some of our profit in order to fund those meals as well, so
          we don’t have to depend on our clientele entirely.
        </p>
        <h2>Example Use Case</h2>
        <br />

        <h3>Use case for meal ordering website:</h3>
        <p>
          Individuals can use the Snazzy’s website to place food orders directly
          to the food truck. When the user places an order, the website
          describes the business model in a language that they understand and
          appeals to their empathetic side. Next, they are politely requested to
          add a meal for the needy. They have the option to completely skip the
          process and then are prompted to pay through the website or pay when
          they pick up their food. Once that is confirmed, the food truck will
          receive a request through their system. The food will then be
          prepared, packaged, and handed to the individual upon arrival. In this
          case, the website must be able to receive orders, process payments,
          and communicate with the restaurant electronically.
        </p>

        <h3>System:</h3> 
        <p>Food ordering website</p>
        <h3>Primary actor:</h3>
        <p>Customer ordering a meal</p>
        <h3>Scenario:</h3>
        <p>
          The user navigates to https://www.snazzys.com and browses through the
          menu options. Once they select their item, they are taken to the next
          screen where they can add another meal for the needy (or skip that
          page). If they choose to add a meal, they are taken to a page where
          there are prepaid meal packets available to purchase and their price
          is listed transparently. They can then select the item(s) place an
          order through the website. The user pays online or verifies they will
          pay in person upon arrival. The order is sent from the app to the
          restaurant’s internal system. The restaurant worker receives and
          processes the electronic order.
        </p>
        <h2>Stakeholders & Users</h2>
        <p>
          The internal stakeholders of Snazzy’s will be myself and my family who
          will help run the kitchen. In addition to my family, the suppliers for
          the equipment inside the food truck, including but not limited to
          kitchen supplies will also play an important part in the idea being
          successful. Finally, my extended family, who has generously offered to
          become investors will also be a part of this dream of mine. As for the
          target users, our customers and patrons will be the ones who will
          externally fund our project by visiting and dining out at our food
          truck.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Target User: John, a hungry customer</h3>
        <p>
          Usage: John uses the online ordering system at Snazzys.com to order
          food so he can pick up the food in person at the truck. Motivations &
          Goals: John is using Snazzys.com to order their next meal. At the same
          time, they also desire to help the community by donating a meal to the
          needy. John is a loving and thoughtful gentleman who wants to end
          hunger one meal at a time.
        </p>
        <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          The project requires the following high-level requirements:
          <li>
            Landing page is the main page where the user is directed to upon
            navigating to the website.
          </li>
          <li>
            About Us page which lists the revenue model and the story behind the
            idea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Menu page with pictures of items that the user can browse through.
          </li>
          <li>
            Online ordering page where the user can order their meals
            internally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Contact Us page where the user can reach out to the Snazzy’s team.
          </li>
        </p>

        <h2>Success measures</h2>
        <p>
          Success for Snazzy’s is not defined by how much profit we make –
          instead the success is measured in terms of client satisfaction,
          patrons that purchase and donate a meal as well as the needy who come
          to the food truck and request a meal. A good key performance indicator
          (KPI) for Snazzy’s will be a counter of how many meals we were able to
          provide to the needy. Of course the profitability of the business will
          depend on how many clientele we are able to drive towards the business
          by properly marketing the idea to local foodbanks, churches & mosques
          as well as local government.
        </p>
        <h2>Competitor</h2>
        <br />
        <h4><a href="www.theadda.io">The Adda Restaurant</a></h4>
        <br />
        <h3>Strengths:</h3>
        <li>Neat and user-friendly webpage</li>
        <li>Menu with prices exists</li>
        <li>Miscellaneous deals are listed on the main page.</li>
        <br />
        <h3>Weakness:</h3>
        <li>Menu is an image</li>
        <li>Bright colors</li>
        <li>Ordering system is grubhub.com</li>

        <h2>Risks</h2>
        <p>
          A major risk is that the business does not take off as intended. If
          the main target users refrain from donating a meal, Snazzy’s won’t be
          able to support the business model by itself. The limited budget is
          another risk because supporting a fully electronic ordering system
          takes a lot of money that needs to be invested upfront before any
          sales can be measured.
